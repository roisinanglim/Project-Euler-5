## Lowest Common Mulitple calculation
[LCM Calculation](https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/lcm.html)  
* Step #1 Calculate the prime factorisation of each of the numbers 1 to 10 
Answer : 2=2 3=3 4=2x2 5=5 6=2x3 7=7 *8=2x2x2* *9=3x3* 10= 5x2 

Step #2 : Identifiy the most common factorisation number 
$2^2$

Ans = 2570
